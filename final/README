How to:

1. Set the desired model to train within run_experiment.sh [1dconv_gru/, 1dconv_transformer/, 2dconv_gru/]
2. Run the bashscript from the command line: ./run_experiment.sh

To interact with the Framework on a more  low level handling of the parameters and models check out the README file inside the scripts folder.
