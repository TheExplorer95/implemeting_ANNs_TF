How to:

1. Acquire the following datasets: GTZAN (/data/GTZAN), fma_small (/data/fma_small_mono_wav) and youtube (/data/test_data) and place them into their respective folder
3. Set the desired model to train within run_experiment.sh [1dconv_gru/, 1dconv_transformer/, 2dconv_gru/]
4. Run the bashscript from the command line: ./run_experiment.sh

To interact with the Framework on a more low level handling of the parameters and models check out the README file inside the scripts folder.
