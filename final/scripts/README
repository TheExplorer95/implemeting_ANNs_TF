For standard users, standard workflow would look as following:

1. Set correct parameters in params.py
2. Run train_cpc.py, generate_embeddings.py, generate_tSNE.py, train_classifiers.py in order

- utils.py: functions to handle automatic directory generation, timer, performance

- ** params.py **: set different hyperparameters and paths, used as global variables

- preprocess_data.py: define functions to handle data pipeline

- encoder_model.py: define different encoder architectures (currently supports 1D-conv and 2D-conv encoders)

- autoregressive_model.py: define different autoregressive model architectures (currently supports GRU and attention-based models)

- cpc_model.py: whole CPC architecture and InfoNCE loss

- custom_training.py: define functions used to train CPC

- ** train_cpc.py **: used to train CPC model and save weights

- ** generate_embeddings.py **: used to create and save embeddings by using trained CPC model weights

- analysis.py: functions generate plots

- ** generate_tSNE.py **: used to generate and save tSNE plots based on saved embeddings

- classifier_model.py: define auto-encoder to reduce dimensionality of embeddings and classifier to classify music genres

- ** train_classifiers.py **: used to train and evaluate classifiers
